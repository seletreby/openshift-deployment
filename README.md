# OpenShift 3.11 Deployment
## Environment Prerequisite preparation
I worked on preparing small development Openshift environment based on OpenShift 3.11. The environment will be hosted on Softlayer. I created three VMs with the following specs:
| Hostname | IP | Function | CPU | Memory | Storage |
| ---------|:---|:---------|:----|:-------|:--------|
|master01.example.com | 158.177.112.229| Master Node | 16 | 32 | 100 |
